      <p>
      Strategy Lead by day, coding connoisseur by night, and all-around outdoor enthusiast. 
      When I'm not crafting innovative strategies at Target, you'll find me immersed in the world of coding, 
      unraveling the mysteries of algorithms like a digital Sherlock Holmes. With a penchant for sports and a love for analytics, 
      I'm the MVP of dissecting game stats and uncovering hidden patterns. Outside the digital realm, 
      you'll catch me basking in the sunshine with my fianc√© and trusty golden retriever, 
      or cheering on my favorite teams with an analytical eye. Let's connect the dots, both on and off the field!
